{Embedding Algorithm for Streaming Data} % Name
{Python} % Skills
{ 
\begin{cvitems}
\item{Proposed a one-pass, low memory usage Multidimensional Scaling ({MDS}) algorithm for streaming data, to overcome the issues of low efficiency in existing embedding algorithms.}
\item{Achieved higher approximation accuracy and a speedup of up to 13X comparing with existing algorithms.}
\item{Implemented the algorithm as a dimension reduction tool in Python, to sequentially process high dimensional image/text data. }
%Demonstrated good results on both image dataset (MNIST, CIFAR10) and text datasets (Twitter, 20NG, etc.) }
\end{cvitems}

\projentry
{Unsupervised Learning for Document Clustering and Labeling} % Name
{Python, JavaScript} % Skills
{ 
\begin{cvitems}
% \item{Developed an unsupervised embedding framework for document clustering. Proposed two metrics to semantically allocate unlabeled documents into the corresponding appropriate cluster.}
\item{Proposed an efficient labeling algorithm for document classification, based on semantic analysis and  feature space understanding, which is further integrated into a cluster-then-label unsupervised learning flow. }
\item{Developed a visualization framework to represent datasets with clusters and labels. Productized as an internal tool in Brookhaven National Lab KBase project.}
